    <h1>About Avalanche Hardwood Floors</h1>
    <p>
      Where quality meets craftsmanship in the heart of Colorado Springs. For
      over two decades, we've been dedicated to honest, quality work at
      affordable prices. Founded by Rick Mutzebaugh, our journey began with a
      passion for woodwork and an opportunity to start a business to deliver
      quality and transparency where other companies in the industry were
      lacking.

      flooring company. We're your partners in enhancing the beauty and value of
      your home or business. Our core values of friendliness, personability, and

      >
    </p>
    <h2>Uncompromising Quality</h2>
    <p>
      Quality is the cornerstone of everything we do. From the selection of
      premium materials to the meticulous attention to detail in every
      installation, sanding, refinishing, repair, or addition.
    </p>
    <p>
      A contractor once hired us for a VIP and said, "treat this like it's your
      house." We said, "No - we will treat it like it's <i>not</i> our house. We
      will treat it like it's <i>their</i> house." We give everyone the VIP treatment,
      whether it's a 10,000sf house in the Broadmoor, or a small repair in a condo.
      Everyone gets our best.
    </p>
    <h2>Customer Satisfaction Guaranteed</h2>
    <p>
      At Avalanche Hardwood Floors, your satisfaction is our top priority. We
      understand that investing in your home or business is a significant
      decision, which is why we go above and beyond to exceed your expectations.
      Should you ever encounter any issues, you can give the owner Rick a call
      and we'll do everything we can to make it right at no cost to you.
    </p>
    <h2>One year warranty</h2>
    <p>
      We stand by our work. In Colorado, hardwood floors can experience a lot of
      movement, expansion, and contraction with the changing of the seasons.
      Hardwood flooring is a living product, and with poor installation, it can
      shift quite a bit - especially in historic homes - and leave gaps or even
      void the manufacturers warranty.
    </p>
    <p>
      We strictly adhere to each manufacturer's installation guidelines to
      ensure you're covered by us and them.
    </p>
    <p>
      On top of any warranties the manufacturers provide, we will fix any issues
      related to our stains, finish, or installations that may appear at no cost
      to you. In the event that a prefinished or engineered product is
      defective, we will work with the manufacturer on your behalf to file a
      warranty claim.
